`Rust-Cast-Shootout`_
=====================

Learning how to cast a Float into a u8. See the `Reddit thread`_ for more information.

The original implementation was written by me for use in `Rust-Trace`_. The min/max approach was suggested by `arthurprs`_ and he also genericised the original implementation. The iterator based approach was suggested by `thiez`_.
