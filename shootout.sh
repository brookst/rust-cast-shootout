=====================
\`Rust-Cast-Shootout\`_
=====================

Learning how to cast a ``Float`` into a ``u8``. See the \`Reddit thread\`_ for more information.

The original implementation was written by me for use in \`Rust-Trace\`_. The min/max approach was suggested by \`arthurprs\`_ and he also genericised the original implementation. The iterator based approach was suggested by \`thiez\`_.
